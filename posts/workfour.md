When a colleague (at my summerjob) ask me to design a card to announce their moving in together, I didn't hesitate to say YES. I said yes because it was summer vacation and I had not done a lot to keep up my illustrator/photoshop and design skills.

I had the idea of using a popular saying on the front of the card. The check marks indicate that they have that item and are ready to move in together. But there is a twist...

Because they were not really moving into a house with a garden and a tree, I put beneath the items what they were really getting. I did this in the antwerp dialect to make it more personal.

On the back of the card I put a big title stating their move plus their new adress and an invitation to go check out their new place. To make it more personal I put their names at the bottem of the card a handwritten font to make it look like they signed the card.

I had fun making this card and I am proud of the result.
