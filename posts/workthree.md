Durning the class about making hybrid animals in Photoshop I could wait to make one of my own. And yes at the end of the lessen the assignment was given 'make your own hybrid animal'.

One my way home from school I already started brainstorming about animals I could combine. My first animal was easy to decide, I am a huge catlady so it was only obvious I would use a cat in my hybrid. But then the animal to combine with my cat ... Why not put the head of my cat on the body of its prey?

I completed the assignment for the course Software 1 Photoshop in one night because I was so excited. My catbird was born and my photoshop skills were improved.
