This assignment was a part of a big group project. For the course Oriented project 2 we were put in groups and had to make our own music label. The groupwork was a lot of work but there was also a individual assignment. Each groupmemeber had to come up with a fictive artist within the gerne given.

Our genre was GRIME. I had never heard of it, I thought at first it was make up. So I went into research modus and started getting to know the genre. It wasn't really my style of music but I went with it.

I came up with the artist Preshes, a female artist who wasn't afraid to speak her mind. I wanted my artist to represent a strong woman who came from nothing and made it for her own.

This album cover I made for her to show she had some hard descisions in her life and that quitting sometimes looked easier but wasn't an option.

Althought the genre wasn't me I still gave it my all. I always have in mind that when I start working I will also have clients with whom I won't agree but still have to make what the client wants.
