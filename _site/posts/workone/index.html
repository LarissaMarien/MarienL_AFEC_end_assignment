<img class="work" src="/media/work1.jpg">
<p>This was one of my favourite assignment during this course, I had real fun making this living room in cinema 4D. This assignment made me realise how cool cinema 4D can be.</p>
<p>The assingment stated 'make a living room with what we already have learned in cinema 4D' but I wanted to go further. The couch we learned to make was pretty basic and didn't really feel like a comfortable couch. So I decided to look up some tutorials and made me a couch that I would buy in real life.</p>
<p>Some element had to be in the living room like the glass, bottle and the bag of lays. I really wanted to make this living room feel real so I made it cosy with candles, pictures (I put picutes of my own cats to make it really real) and the books.</p>
<p>In the end I was really happy with the result and at the same time I learned a lot about cinema 4D.</p>
