<img class="work" src="/media/work5.jpg">
<p>This was an assignment for the course Crossmedia Software 3 during my second year.</p>
<p>For this assignment we had to make something/anything in cinema 4D from scratch. We were allowed to use tutorials but had to mention them in a document when we submitted the assignment.</p>
<p>I found my inspiration in real life. I was going to fair and saw a person making balloon animals, this gave me the idea of making my something in balloons in cinema 4D.</p>
<p>Once behind my laptop to start bringing my idea to life, I found a great tutorial to help me. But there was one thing I had to figure out myself.</p>
<p>The tutorial was only for differnt shapes in balloons like a heart or a star. I didn't just wanted to copy the tutorial and wanted to put my own touch in this assignment. What other way to make it your own then putting your own name in it.</p>
<p>And so my idea was born, my name in balloons.</p>
