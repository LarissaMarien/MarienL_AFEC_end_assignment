<p>Durning the class about making hybrid animals in Photoshop I could wait to make one of my own. And yes at the end of the lessen the assignment was given 'make your own hybrid animal'.</p>
<p>One my way home from school I already started brainstorming about animals I could combine. My first animal was easy to decide, I am a huge catlady so it was only obvious I would use a cat in my hybrid. But then the animal to combine with my cat ... Why not put the head of my cat on the body of its prey?</p>
<p>I completed the assignment for the course Software 1 Photoshop in one night because I was so excited. My catbird was born and my photoshop skills were improved.</p>
